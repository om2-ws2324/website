You are free to add additional sections as necessary. The report, including visualizations, should be no more than 10 pages long. There is no minimum page requirement; however, you should comprehensively address all of the topics stated in the file.\nBe selective in what you include in your final write-up.

Describe the data and definitions of key variables. It should also include some exploratory data analysis. All of the EDA won‚Äôt fit in the paper, so focus on the EDA for the response variable and a few other interesting variables and relationships.\n\nGrading criteria\nThe research question and motivation are clearly stated in the introduction, including citations for the data source and any external research. The data are clearly described, including a description about how the data were originally collected and a concise definition of the variables relevant to understanding the report. The data cleaning process is clearly described, including any decisions made in the process (e.g., creating new variables, removing observations, etc.) The explanatory data analysis helps the reader better understand the observations in the data along with interesting and relevant relationships between the variables. It incorporates appropriate visualizations and summary statistics.\n\n\n\nVisualizations\nThis section includes a profound description of your visualization selection and creation process (with regard to the topics covered in our course). Explain the reasoning for the type of visualization considered for the project. Additionally, show how you arrived at the final visualizaion by describing the selection process, variable transformations (if needed) and any other relevant considerations that were part of the creation process.\n\nGrading criteria\nThe selection steps are appropriate for the data and (research) question. The group used a thorough and careful approach to select the final visualization(s); the approach is clearly described in the report. The visualization selection process took into account the aspects covered in the course (law of proximity, ‚Ä¶). If violations of optimal visualization conditions are still present, there was a reasonable attempt to address the violations based on the course content.\n\n\n\nConclusion + recommended action\nIn this section you‚Äôll include a summary of what you have learned about your (research) question along with (statistical) arguments supporting your conclusions. In addition, discuss the limitations of your analysis and provide suggestions on ways the analysis could be improved.\nAny potential issues pertaining to the reliability and validity of your data and appropriateness of the statistical analysis should also be discussed here. Lastly, this section will include your recommended action.\n\nGrading criteria\nOverall conclusions from analysis are clearly described, and the visualization results are put into the larger context of the subject matter and original (research) question. There is thoughtful consideration of potential limitations of the data and/or analysis. The recommended action is plausible/convincing and clearly described.\n\n\n\nOrganization + formatting\nThis is an assessment of the overall presentation and formatting of the written report.\n\nGrading criteria\nThe report neatly written and organized with clear section headers and appropriately sized figures with informative labels. Numerical results are displayed with a reasonable number of digits, and all visualizations are similar formatted as the examples shown in this course.\nAll citations and links are properly formatted. If there is an appendix, it is reasonably organized and easy for the reader to find relevant information. All code, warnings, and messages are suppressed. The main body of the written report (not including the appendix) is no longer than 10 pages."
